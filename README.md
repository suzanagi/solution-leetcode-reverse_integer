# Reverse Integer
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

# Example
 - Input: -123 ... Output: -321
 - Input: 120 ... Output: 21
 - Input: 1534236469 ... Output: 9646324351
